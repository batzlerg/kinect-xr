## Context
Read the files available to you before proceeding.

Your task is to expand the high-level implementation plan into a comprehensive, detailed implementation guide that a developer could follow to execute the phase successfully.

Focus tightly in on the first phase of the implementation plan detailed in `Kinect XR Implementation Plan.md`. Deliver a step by step guide to addressing all parts of that first phase, considering MacOS as the development platform. Think critically about best practices, assume from-scratch startup, and double-check your output.

## Process
Use a progressive expansion approach with three stages:

### Stage 1: Framework Analysis
First, analyze the implementation plan with focus on Phase 1. Identify:
- Core technical components requiring additional detail
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Technical challenges that need detailed solutions
- Knowledge domains required for implementation

Provide this analysis as an outline with brief annotations.

### Stage 2: Detailed Component Expansion
For each component identified in Stage 1, create comprehensive implementation details including:
- Complete working code implementations with documentation
- Detailed step-by-step setup and configuration instructions
- Guidance for integration with other components
- Platform-specific considerations

### Stage 3: Integration and Validation
Your final stage should include:
- A cohesive integration of all components
- Testing methodology with example test code
- Validation criteria for successful implementation
- Troubleshooting guidance if issues seem likely from your research

## Final Output
In your final output, ensure that you:
- Maintain the original plan's structure while adding significant correct and information-supported detail
- Provided complete code implementations with explanations
- Included practical platform-specific considerations for code execution and for developing the project on macOS
- Added thorough code testing strategies, and included criteria to verify success before moving to the next phase

When files are available in the context that can inform this expansion, reference their contents, structure, and approach for consistency. When conflicting information, knowledge limitations, or uncertainties are encountered, highlight these specifically and suggest alternative approaches where possible.
